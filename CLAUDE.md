### Guardrails & Rules

- **Never put Claude branding in any commit**
- **Commits should use conventional commits, with emojis, and if there is ever a version tag, follow semver.
- **Always write tests when feasible** and run as appropriate
- **Proper error handling** with meaningful stdout/stderr from external tools
- **Favor existing patterns** for consistency, suggest improvements when beneficial
- **Update documentation** when requested: README (end-user POV) + CLAUDE.md (architecture)
- **Always consider the relationship between schema, caching, and actions**

### Development Workflow

- **Follow Cobra best practices** for CLI verbs and structure
- **Shell out to system tools** (apt, flatpak, snap, dconf)
- **Check tool availability** on init with installation offers
- **Maintain consistency** across all implementations

### Testing Requirements

- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- Integration tests using actual system commands
- Validation tests for configuration schemas
- Error handling and edge case coverage

**Top-level Structure:**

```yaml
version: "1.0"     # Configuration schema version
includes: [...]    # Optional: Include additional YAML files
package_defaults:  # Optional: Override internal package manager defaults
  apt: ["-y"]
  flatpak: ["--user"]
  snap: ["--classic"]
repositories:      # Repository management (apt, flatpak)
  apt: [...]
  flatpak: [...]
packages:          # Package management (apt, flatpak, snap)
  apt: [...]
  flatpak: [...]
  snap: [...]
files:             # Unified file management

```

**Three-Tier Package Flag System:**

1. **Internal Defaults (Tier 1)**: Built into configr
   - APT: `["-y", "--no-install-recommends"]`
   - Snap: `[]` (interactive by design)
   - Flatpak: `["--system", "--assumeyes"]`
2. **User Package Defaults (Tier 2)**: Global overrides in `package_defaults`
3. **Per-Package Flags (Tier 3)**: Highest priority, package-specific overrides

**Repository Management Schema:**

```yaml
repositories:
  apt:
    python39:                     # Repository name/identifier
      ppa: "deadsnakes/ppa"       # Ubuntu PPA format: "user/repo"
    docker:
      uri: "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
      key: "https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg"  # GPG key URL or key ID
  flatpak:
    flathub:                      # Remote name
      url: "https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo"  # Required: repository URL
      user: false                 # Optional: user-only install (default: system)
    kde:
      url: "https://distribute.kde.org/kdeapps.flatpakrepo"
      user: true
```

**File Management Schema:**

```yaml
files:
  filename:
    source: "path/to/source"         # Required: source file path
    destination: "/target/path"      # Required: where to place the file
    owner: "user"                    # Optional: file owner (preserves if omitted)
    group: "group"                   # Optional: file group (preserves if omitted)
    mode: "644"                      # Optional: file permissions (preserves if omitted)
    backup: true                     # Optional: backup existing file before replacing
    copy: true                       # Optional: copy file instead of symlinking (default: false)
    interactive: true                # Optional: enable interactive conflict resolution
    prompt_permissions: true         # Optional: prompt for permission changes
    prompt_ownership: true           # Optional: prompt for ownership changes
```

### Command Interface (CLI Design)

**Command Structure:**

```bash
configr [global-flags] <command> [command-flags] [arguments]
```

**Available Commands:**

- `configr validate [file]` - Validate configuration without applying changes
- `configr apply [file]` - Apply configuration changes to system
- `configr apply --dry-run` - Preview changes without applying
- `configr apply --interactive` - Enable interactive prompts for conflicts and permissions
- `configr apply --remove-packages=false` - Skip package removal operations
- `configr apply --optimize=false` - Disable caching and optimization
- `configr cache stats` - Show cache usage statistics
- `configr cache clear` - Clear all cached data
- `configr help [command]` - Show help for any command
- `configr man` - Generate Unix man pages
- `configr completion [shell]` - Generate shell completions
- `configr --version` - Show version and build information

**Global Flags:**

- `-c, --config <file>` - Specify config file path
- `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output
- `--no-color` - Disable colored output

**Config File Discovery (in order):**

1. Explicit path via `--config` flag
2. Environment variable `CONFIGR_CONFIG`
3. Current directory (`./configr.yaml`)
4. XDG config directory (`~/.config/configr/configr.yaml`)
5. Home directory (`~/configr.yaml`)
6. System config (`/etc/configr/configr.yaml`)
7. Local system config (`/usr/local/etc/configr/configr.yaml`)

### Error Handling & UX Standards

**Validation Features:**

- Schema validation (required fields, correct formats)
- File existence checks (source files exist before deployment)
- Permission validation (file modes and ownership)
- Path safety (prevents unsafe destinations like `../../../etc/passwd`)
- Package name validation (manager-specific rules)
- DConf path validation (dconf settings paths and value formats)

**Error Reporting Style (Rust-inspired):**

```
error: source file not found
  --> configr.yaml:15:5
   |
   | files.vimrc.source: dotfiles/vimrc
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ file does not exist
   |
   = help: create the file or check the path
   = note: looked for: /home/user/dotfiles/vimrc
   = suggestion: did you mean "dotfiles/.vimrc"?
```

**User Experience Standards:**

- Structured logging with charmbracelet/log
- Clear success/warning/error indicators (âœ“, âš , âœ—)
- Position-aware error reporting with line/column numbers
- Verbose mode for detailed operation insights
- Quick fix suggestions with immediate actionable solutions

### External Dependencies

    optional: true
    conditions:
      - type: "env"
        value: "NODE_ENV=development"
  
  # Multiple conditions (all must be true)
  - glob: "hosts/*.yaml"
    optional: true
    conditions:
      - type: "hostname"
        value: "workstation"
        operator: "contains"
      - type: "file_exists"
        value: "/etc/workstation-config"
```

**Condition Types:**

- **`os`**: Operating system detection (linux, darwin, windows)
- **`hostname`**: System hostname matching with operators
- **`env`**: Environment variable existence and value checking
- **`file_exists`**: File system existence checks
- **`dir_exists`**: Directory existence validation

**Operators:**

- **`equals`**: Exact string matching (default)
- **`contains`**: Substring matching
- **`matches`**: Regular expression matching
- **`not_equals`**: Negated exact matching
- **`not_contains`**: Negated substring matching

**Advanced Operations:**

- `LoadConfigurationAdvanced()`: Main loading entry point with full feature support
- `resolveGlobPattern()`: Pattern matching with YAML file filtering
- `evaluateConditions()`: Multi-condition evaluation with AND logic
- `ValidateIncludeSpec()`: Comprehensive validation of include specifications
- `GetSystemInfo()`: System information for debugging conditional includes

**Path Resolution Rules:**

1. **Simple includes**: `packages.yaml` â†’ loads `packages.yaml`
2. **Directory includes**: `packages/` â†’ loads `packages/default.yaml`
3. **Glob patterns**: `packages/*.yaml` â†’ loads all matching YAML files
4. **Conditional paths**: Evaluated only when conditions are met
5. **Optional includes**: Skip gracefully when files don't exist

**Validation and Safety:**

- **Circular dependency detection**: Prevents infinite include loops
- **Path traversal protection**: Validates against `../` patterns
- **Glob syntax validation**: Tests pattern validity before evaluation
- **Condition validation**: Ensures valid condition types and operators
- **Optional include handling**: Graceful degradation for missing files

**Integration:**

- **Optimized loading**: Seamless integration with existing cache system
- **Validation system**: Enhanced validation with position-aware error reporting
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing configurations continue to work unchanged
- **Error reporting**: Rust-style error messages with actionable suggestions

**Performance Considerations:**

- **Lazy evaluation**: Conditions evaluated only when needed
- **Cached system info**: OS and hostname cached per loader instance
- **Efficient glob matching**: Uses Go's optimized filepath.Glob
- **Path deduplication**: Prevents loading same file multiple times

This advanced include system provides powerful configuration organization capabilities while maintaining configr's commitment to exceptional UX and system administrator-friendly operation.
