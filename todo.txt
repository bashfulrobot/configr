## Implementation Strategy Notes

**Dependency Rationale:**

1. **CLI Commands First** - Essential for tool completeness, no dependencies
2. **File Management** - Core functionality that other features depend on
3. **Configuration Features** - Build on stable file management foundation
4. **Package Features** - Optional enhancements, independent of other systems
5. **UX Improvements** - Polish existing functionality before testing
6. **Testing Last** - Comprehensive testing after all features are stable

**Key Principles:**

- Complete core functionality before adding enhancements
- Establish stable APIs before comprehensive testing
- Leave documentation and testing until features are finalized
- Build dependent features in logical order
- Separate optional features from core requirements
